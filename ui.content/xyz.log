**Subject:** A Vision Worth Sharing: Invitation to Explore the Future  

Dear [Super Boss’s Name],  

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. With only a few weeks remaining in my tenure at [Bank Name], I find myself reflecting on the journey here. There is a line from *Great Expectations* that resonates deeply with me: *“Pause you who read this, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold, of thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the formation of the first link on one memorable day.”*  

A year ago, I joined this institution with a heart full of aspiration, believing in the transformative potential we could unlock together. Over the past year, I have worked tirelessly to craft a three-year technical vision—a roadmap that marries innovation with pragmatism and positions [Bank Name] as a leader in agility and efficiency. This vision, combined with the methods I introduced, has already brought measurable improvements in development speed and quality.  

Yet, as with any grand endeavor, there were challenges—often subtle, often unspoken, but always significant. There is wisdom in Holmes’s words: *“It is my business to know what other people don’t know.”* While I sought to foster a culture of bold thinking and collaboration, certain barriers concealed themselves in the shadows of our processes and customs, rendering the journey uphill.  

As I prepare to part ways, I feel an urgent responsibility to share this vision with you. Not out of self-interest, but from the deep belief that its execution can reshape how we create, collaborate, and lead. I humbly request a brief meeting with you to present this roadmap, showcase its successes, and illuminate the path it lays before us.  

My aim is not to critique but to inspire. As Dickens wrote, *“I have been bent and broken, but—I hope—into a better shape.”* Similarly, this institution has the capacity to evolve, and I believe my insights can contribute meaningfully to that evolution.  

If your schedule permits, I would be deeply honored to have this conversation. It is a chance to look ahead and perhaps to weave into the tapestry of this great institution a thread of innovation that reflects its true potential.  

Thank you for considering this request. Regardless of your decision, it has been a privilege to serve under your leadership and to contribute in my small way to this journey.  

Warm regards,  
[Your Full Name]
